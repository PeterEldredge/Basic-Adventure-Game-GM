# Basic-Adventure-Game-GM
Summary
A basic adventure game (Zelda-like) I made in Game Maker. This game has some good puzzles and ideas (if a little unoriginal), the problem is that it is unfairly difficult. I am putting it here because I think if you can make it past the first part, there are some really good redeeming qualities.

My Contributions
I took all of the characters and some of the items from online sprite sheets. In terms of art I tweaked the character manually, adding the sword on his back. I also made the sword animation. Other than the art I took from the internet I designed and created everything (including the terrible humor).

Issues / What I would like to fix
The game is very challenging (and not in a good way). I didn't know how to implement checkpoints at the time and the game has an element of trial and error which makes it very frustrating. Also, if an enemy hits you, you are good as dead due to the terrible collisions with enemies.

How to play it
To play the game you need to first download the zip, then extract the files from the application file. When that finishes you should be able to open the application.
